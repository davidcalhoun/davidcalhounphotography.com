I returned to Kyoto a few more times over the years to try to recapture that feeling, but have never quite been able to experience it again.\n\nI'm reminded of a [nostalgic poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Shropshire_Lad):\n > Into my heart an air that kills\n
> From yon far country blows:\n
> What are those blue remembered hills,\n
> What spires, what farms are those?\n
> &nbsp;\n
> That is the land of lost content,\n
> I see it shining plain,\n
> The happy highways where I went\n
> And cannot come again.`,
