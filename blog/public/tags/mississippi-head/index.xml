      <description>Mississippi head on Mount Hood, Oregon  The first week of this month, my friend Mark and I took a road trip up north. We started in LA and found ourselves at Mount Hood, Oregon a few days later - out furthest point north before turning around and starting the drive back.
This was a really crazy day weather-wise. As we approached, we actually mistook Mount Jefferson for Mount Hood. The former seemed to be more brilliant, bathed in beautiful sunlight.</description>
