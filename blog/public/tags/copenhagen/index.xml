      <description>Søren Kierkegaard statue at the Royal Danish Library  Before my trip to Copenhagen a few weeks back, I did a bit of research to track down places of interest in respect to Søren Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s life. I ended up doing more research after my trip, and was able to track down even more locations, all of which I plotted on a map for convenience. That should help you out if you ever visit, and are at all interested in Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s life!</description>

      <description>Just a quick one!
A very quick hyperlapse up the spiral walkway of the Round Tower in Copenhagen. This tower was originally built in the 17th century by Danish king Christian IV, who built it as an astronomical observatory. There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of a planetarium of sorts on the top, but it was closed off to the public while I was there unfortunately.</description>

      <description>Only cellphone photos in here, I apologize in advance!
I booked a ticket on Scandinavian Airlines through Hopper. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad - I ended up flying United (boo) on a quick layover in San Francisco, where I had to weave my way through to the international terminal.
I knew I was at the right gate judging by the amount of blonde hair I saw waiting there patiently and quietly!</description>
