      <description>The sun eclipsed by the moon, with visible corona and sun flares. Seen from the national forest south of John Day, Oregon (August 21, 2017 Great American Eclipse)  It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 100 years since the last solar eclipse swept across the US from coast-to-coast, so I figured it was well worth the drive to try to experience the eclipse totality. That&amp;rsquo;s the moment when for a few minutes the moon fully covers the sun, minus the visible solar corona.</description>

      <description>I took a quick trip on a local hike to scout out a location. In the process I made a quick video about appreciating what you have (e.g. local nature) versus more exotic locales.
Since I was just scouting out locations, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take any great photos, but I did snap a few for future reference! Time to come back for a sunset or sunrise!
