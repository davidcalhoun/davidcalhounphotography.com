      <description>The sun eclipsed by the moon, with visible corona and sun flares. Seen from the national forest south of John Day, Oregon (August 21, 2017 Great American Eclipse)  It&amp;rsquo;s been almost 100 years since the last solar eclipse swept across the US from coast-to-coast, so I figured it was well worth the drive to try to experience the eclipse totality. That&amp;rsquo;s the moment when for a few minutes the moon fully covers the sun, minus the visible solar corona.</description>

      <description>Illumination Rock on Mount Hood, Oregon  The first week of this month, my friend Mark and I took a road trip up north. We started in LA and found ourselves at Mount Hood, Oregon a few days later - out furthest point north before turning around and starting the drive back.
This was a really crazy day weather-wise. As we approached, we actually mistook Mount Jefferson for Mount Hood. The former seemed to be more brilliant, bathed in beautiful sunlight.</description>
