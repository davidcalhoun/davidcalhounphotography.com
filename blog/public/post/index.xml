      <description>I took a quick trip on a local hike to scout out a location. In the process I made a quick video about appreciating what you have (e.g. local nature) versus more exotic locales.
Since I was just scouting out locations, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take any great photos, but I did snap a few for future reference! Time to come back for a sunset or sunrise!

      <description>  Check out the first video here.
A few weeks back I took another trip to Japan, a few days of which were dedicated to taking photos.
In this second video I visit the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest in western Kyoto and the Fushimi Inari Shrine just south of Kyoto city.
Arashiyama Bamboo Forest in Kyoto, Japan  Some general tips from the video:
 for popular locations, book lodging nearby and walk over SUPER early to beat the crowds (you need to walk because public transportation doesn&amp;rsquo;t run 24&amp;frasl;7 in Japan) HDR has legitimate applications when there are extreme exposure differences (bright whites and dark blacks), such as in forests where the light shines through the trees especially for low light situations, bring a tripod and shoot at low ISO if you want a quality print with little noise  Fushimi Inari Shrine torii in Kyoto, Japan  </description>

      <description>Only cellphone photos in here, I apologize in advance!
I booked a ticket on Scandinavian Airlines through Hopper. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad - I ended up flying United (boo) on a quick layover in San Francisco, where I had to weave my way through to the international terminal.
I knew I was at the right gate judging by the amount of blonde hair I saw waiting there patiently and quietly!</description>

      <description>Illumination Rock on Mount Hood, Oregon  The first week of this month, my friend Mark and I took a road trip up north. We started in LA and found ourselves at Mount Hood, Oregon a few days later - out furthest point north before turning around and starting the drive back.
This was a really crazy day weather-wise. As we approached, we actually mistook Mount Jefferson for Mount Hood. The former seemed to be more brilliant, bathed in beautiful sunlight.</description>

      <description>A few weeks back I took another trip to Japan, a few days of which were dedicated to taking photos. In this first video you can really tell that I got around - I definitely got some good use of the JR Pass, which gives you unlimited access to the bullet trains.
