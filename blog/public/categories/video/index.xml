      <description>Søren Kierkegaard statue at the Royal Danish Library  Before my trip to Copenhagen a few weeks back, I did a bit of research to track down places of interest in respect to Søren Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s life. I ended up doing more research after my trip, and was able to track down even more locations, all of which I plotted on a map for convenience. That should help you out if you ever visit, and are at all interested in Kierkegaard&amp;rsquo;s life!</description>

      <description>Just a quick one!
A very quick hyperlapse up the spiral walkway of the Round Tower in Copenhagen. This tower was originally built in the 17th century by Danish king Christian IV, who built it as an astronomical observatory. There&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of a planetarium of sorts on the top, but it was closed off to the public while I was there unfortunately.</description>

      <description>I took a quick trip on a local hike to scout out a location. In the process I made a quick video about appreciating what you have (e.g. local nature) versus more exotic locales.
Since I was just scouting out locations, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take any great photos, but I did snap a few for future reference! Time to come back for a sunset or sunrise!

      <title>Video: Travel photography in Japan: part two</title>

      <description>  Check out the first video here.
A few weeks back I took another trip to Japan, a few days of which were dedicated to taking photos.
In this second video I visit the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest in western Kyoto and the Fushimi Inari Shrine just south of Kyoto city.
Arashiyama Bamboo Forest in Kyoto, Japan  Some general tips from the video:
 for popular locations, book lodging nearby and walk over SUPER early to beat the crowds (you need to walk because public transportation doesn&amp;rsquo;t run 24&amp;frasl;7 in Japan) HDR has legitimate applications when there are extreme exposure differences (bright whites and dark blacks), such as in forests where the light shines through the trees especially for low light situations, bring a tripod and shoot at low ISO if you want a quality print with little noise  Fushimi Inari Shrine torii in Kyoto, Japan  </description>

      <description>A few weeks back I took another trip to Japan, a few days of which were dedicated to taking photos. In this first video you can really tell that I got around - I definitely got some good use of the JR Pass, which gives you unlimited access to the bullet trains.
