      <description>Summer sunset seen from Bertha Peak (Big Bear Lake, California)  I did a quick hike up to Bertha Peak the other day to try to get a different perspective of my local mountains at sunset. This is a slightly different position than the view from Gray&amp;rsquo;s Peak, offering a more unobstructed view of the sunset and lake.
I just filmed this with my phone, so apologies for the quality, and sorry that my face is so close to the camera!</description>

      <description>Just a quick video of my hike up Gray&amp;rsquo;s Peak at sunset. I was slightly late and didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the top at the time I expected, but I did unexpectedly see the sunset from a location about 20 minutes or so from the end of the hike. I decided to be adaptable and setup right down there!
I ended up shooting the Hanna Rocks with the sunset in the background, making for a decent foreground plus background combination!</description>

      <description>Illumination Rock on Mount Hood, Oregon  The first week of this month, my friend Mark and I took a road trip up north. We started in LA and found ourselves at Mount Hood, Oregon a few days later - out furthest point north before turning around and starting the drive back.
This was a really crazy day weather-wise. As we approached, we actually mistook Mount Jefferson for Mount Hood. The former seemed to be more brilliant, bathed in beautiful sunlight.</description>
