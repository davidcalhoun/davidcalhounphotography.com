      <description>Summer sunset seen from Bertha Peak (Big Bear Lake, California)  I did a quick hike up to Bertha Peak the other day to try to get a different perspective of my local mountains at sunset. This is a slightly different position than the view from Gray&amp;rsquo;s Peak, offering a more unobstructed view of the sunset and lake.
I just filmed this with my phone, so apologies for the quality, and sorry that my face is so close to the camera!</description>

      <description>Just a quick video of my hike up Gray&amp;rsquo;s Peak at sunset. I was slightly late and didn&amp;rsquo;t make it to the top at the time I expected, but I did unexpectedly see the sunset from a location about 20 minutes or so from the end of the hike. I decided to be adaptable and setup right down there!
I ended up shooting the Hanna Rocks with the sunset in the background, making for a decent foreground plus background combination!</description>

      <description>I took a quick trip on a local hike to scout out a location. In the process I made a quick video about appreciating what you have (e.g. local nature) versus more exotic locales.
Since I was just scouting out locations, I didn&amp;rsquo;t take any great photos, but I did snap a few for future reference! Time to come back for a sunset or sunrise!
