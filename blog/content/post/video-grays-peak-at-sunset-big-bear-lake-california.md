Just a quick video of my hike up Gray's Peak at sunset.  I was slightly late and didn't make it to the top at the time I expected, but I did unexpectedly see the sunset from a location about 20 minutes or so from the end of the hike.  I decided to be adaptable and setup right down there!

I ended up shooting the Hanna Rocks with the sunset in the background, making for a decent foreground plus background combination!

After the light from the sunset died out a bit, I hiked to the top and got an ok shot of the North Shore area of Big Bear at magic hour:

It was a big creepy heading back!  I put on my headlamp and immediately saw some yellow eyes staring back at me about fifty feet away.  I saw a black bear the last time I was up here, so I was a little freaked out.  Interesting how much you can guess from the personality of the animal though.  Those yellow eyes were curious, but didn't like having a light blasted into its face - so it turned its head most of the time.  Occassionally it snuck a few peeks back at me before I was ready to head back down.

Down the mountain I saw what looked almost like two floating fireflies in the night.  The only problem: we don't really have fireflies in California (we do in some rare places if you know where to look, but not here in the desert).  I'm not sure, but I think it may have been one of the two deer I saw on the way up.

Nothing much more eventful on the hike down except seeing a few scorpions right in the path!  I suspect I was more of a danger to them.. they seemed pretty mellow.

I did snap a quick photo with my cellphone:
