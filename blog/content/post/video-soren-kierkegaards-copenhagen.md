Before my trip to Copenhagen a few weeks back, I did a bit of research to track down places of interest in respect to Søren Kierkegaard's life.  I ended up doing more research after my trip, and was able to track down even more locations, all of which I <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=16lkqqTI-p_UibYwTsbEcJqUOSPs&usp=sharing">plotted on a map for convenience</a>.  That should help you out if you ever visit, and are at all interested in Kierkegaard's life!  Be sure to click on each map point for more details.

I also filmed a lot of the places of interest in Kierkegaard's life, which I put together in the video below.  It's a bit different style than my other photography videos - this one is mostly just location scouting and documenting!  More of a travel video of a very specialized interest.  It was fun to put together, and a nice change of pace.  I may do this again sometime with future locations!
