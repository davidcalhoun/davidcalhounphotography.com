The first week of this month, my friend Mark and I took a road trip up north.  We started in LA and found ourselves at Mount Hood, Oregon a few days later - out furthest point north before turning around and starting the drive back.

This was a really crazy day weather-wise.  As we approached, we actually mistook Mount Jefferson for Mount Hood.  The former seemed to be more brilliant, bathed in beautiful sunlight.  Mount Hood, on the other hand, had a certain resemblance to Mount Doom from Lord of the Rings, with thunder storms brewing directly over it.

As we got closer it started to rain, then it started to hail - *very hard*.  I slowed my car down to a crawl and reached a point where I realized I didn't know what to do.  Would the hail damage my car?  Would it hail even harder?  Should I just keep going?

Fortunately the hail let up after a few minutes.  The car didn't appear to have any damage - and the hail and rain seemed to have cleaned up a large portion of the bug splatter that I was collecting on the front of my car (for a 2500 mile drive, I was kind of curious to see how many bugs I could collect. Oh well, another time I guess).

We took a few landscape photos, then headed inside Timerline Lodge and waited out the rest of the storm inside the lodge, including a stop at the great Ram's Head Bar.

Afterwards we couldn't resist heading out again and getting shots of Mount Hood at sundown.

Here's a shot of a feature on Mount Hood called Illumination Rock, just above the ski slopes.  I really loved the great moody light here.  Really crazy weather makes really ideal photos I guess!
