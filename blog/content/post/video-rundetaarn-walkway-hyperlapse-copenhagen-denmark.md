Just a quick one!

A very quick hyperlapse up the spiral walkway of the Round Tower in Copenhagen.  This tower was originally built in the 17th century by Danish king Christian IV, who built it as an astronomical observatory.  There's a little bit of a planetarium of sorts on the top, but it was closed off to the public while I was there unfortunately.
