I did a quick hike up to Bertha Peak the other day to try to get a different perspective of my local mountains at sunset.  This is a slightly different position than the view from Gray's Peak, offering a more unobstructed view of the sunset and lake.

I just filmed this with my phone, so apologies for the quality, and sorry that my face is so close to the camera!  I guess I learned the hard way.  I'm never buying a selfie stick if I can help it, so I'll try to use my GoPro more instead in the future!

This trip was a bit of a gear test as well!  It's the first time I really used my hiking poles, which I learned are very handy if you have a backpack of any sizeable weight.  I still sometimes feel like some arthropod when using them, so I guess you could say I'm still getting used to them!

The Pacific Crest Trail runs right across the hike up to Bertha Peak, so I am thinking of doing an overnight on the trail in the very near future.  Time to give more gear a try (bear bag, tent, etc)!  But I'll save that for next time.
