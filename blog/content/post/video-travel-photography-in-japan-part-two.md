Check out the first video <a href="https://davidcalhounphotography.com/blog/video-travel-photography-in-japan-part-one/">here</a>.


A few weeks back I took another trip to Japan, a few days of which were dedicated to taking photos.

In this second video I visit the Arashiyama Bamboo Forest in western Kyoto and the Fushimi Inari Shrine just south of Kyoto city.

Some general tips from the video:

* for popular locations, book lodging nearby and walk over SUPER early to beat the crowds (you need to walk because public transportation doesn't run 24/7 in Japan)
* HDR has legitimate applications when there are extreme exposure differences (bright whites and dark blacks), such as in forests where the light shines through the trees
* especially for low light situations, bring a tripod and shoot at low ISO if you want a quality print with little noise
